# Use the layout() method
https://docs.conan.io/2/tutorial/consuming_packages/the_flexibility_of_conanfile_py.html#use-the-layout-method
>In the previous examples, every time we executed a conan install command, we had to use the –output-folder argument to define where we wanted to create the files that Conan generates. There’s a neater way to decide where we want Conan to generate the files for the build system that will allow us to decide, for example, if we want different output folders depending on the type of CMake generator we are using. You can define this directly in the conanfile.py inside the layout() method and make it work for every platform without adding more changes.
