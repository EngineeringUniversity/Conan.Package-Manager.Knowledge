# [How to cross-compile your applications using Conan: host and build contexts¶](https://docs.conan.io/2/tutorial/consuming_packages/cross_building_with_conan.html)

>In some cases, you don’t have the toolchain available on the build platform. For those cases, you can use a Conan package for the cross-compiler and add it to the [tool_requires] section of the profile. For an example of cross-building using a toolchain package, please check [this example](https://docs.conan.io/2/examples/cross_build/toolchain_packages.html#example-cross-build-toolchain-package-use).
